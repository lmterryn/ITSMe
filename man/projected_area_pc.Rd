\usage{
projected_area_pc(
  pc,
  concavity = 2,
  plot = FALSE,
  plotcolors = c("#000000", "#08aa7c")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pc}{The point cloud as a data.frame with columns X,Y,Z (e.g. output of
\code{\link{read_tree_pc}}.}

\item{concavity}{Numeric value (default=2) concavity for the computation of a
concave hull based on \code{\link[concaveman]{concaveman}}.}

\item{plot}{Logical (default=FALSE), indicates if the optimised circle
fitting is plotted.}

\item{plotcolors}{list of two colors for plotting. Only relevant when plot =
TRUE. The stem points and the concave hull are colored by the first and
second element of this list respectively.}
}
\value{
The projected area (numeric value) as the area of the concave hull
computed from the points of point cloud. Also optionally (plot=TRUE) plots
the concave hull fitting and in this case returns a list with the area as
first element and the plot as the second element.
}
\description{
Returns the projected area measured from a point cloud.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{\link[sf]{st_area}} and
\code{\link[concaveman]{concaveman}} to calculate the area of the concave
hull fitted to the provided point clouds.

# Read tree point cloud and calculate the projected tree area
