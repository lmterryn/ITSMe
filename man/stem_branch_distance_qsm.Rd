\usage{
stem_branch_distance_qsm(
  cylinder,
  treedata,
  normalisation = "no",
  pc = NA,
  buttress = FALSE,
  thresholdR2 = 0.001,
  slice_thickness = 0.06,

}
\arguments{
\item{cylinder}{Cylinder field of a TreeQSM that is returned by
\code{\link{read_tree_qsm}}.}

\item{treedata}{Treedata field of a TreeQSM that is returned by
\code{\link{read_tree_qsm}}.}

\item{normalisation}{Can either be "dbh" or nothing. In case of "dbh" the
average distance is divided by the DBH (Akerblom et al., 2017).}

\item{pc}{The tree point cloud as a data.frame with columns X,Y,Z. Output of
\code{\link{read_tree_pc}}. Default is NA and indicates no tree point cloud
is available. Only relevant if normalisation equals "dbh".}

\item{buttress}{Logical (default=FALSE), indicates if the trees have
buttresses. Only relevant if pc is available and normalisation equals
"dbh".}

\item{thresholdR2}{Numeric value (default=0.001). Parameter of the
\code{\link{dbh_pc}} function used to calculate the diameter at breast
height. Only relevant if the tree point cloud is available and buttress ==
FALSE.}

\item{slice_thickness}{Numeric value (default = 0.06). Parameter of the
\code{\link{dbh_pc}} and \code{\link{dab_pc}} functions used to calculate
the diameter at breast height and above buttresses. Only relevant if the
tree point cloud is available.}

\item{thresholdbuttress}{Numeric value (default=0.001). Parameter of the
\code{\link{dab_pc}} function used to calculate the diameter above
buttresses. Only relevant if the tree point cloud is available and buttress
== TRUE.}

\item{maxbuttressheight}{Numeric value (default=7). Parameter of the
\code{\link{dab_pc}} function used to calculate the diameter at breast
height. Only relevant if the tree point cloud is available and buttress ==
TRUE.}

\item{concavity}{Numeric value (default=4) concavity for the computation of
the functional diameter using a concave hull based on
\code{\link[concaveman]{concaveman}}. only relevant when a point cloud is
provided.}

\item{dtm}{The digital terrain model as a data.frame with columns X,Y,Z
(default = NA). If the digital terrain model is in the same format as a
point cloud it can also be read with \code{\link{read_tree_pc}}. only
relevant when a point cloud is provided.}

\item{r}{Numeric value (default=5) r which determines the range taken for the
dtm. Should be at least the resolution of the dtm. Only relevant when a dtm
is provided.}
}
\value{
The stem branch distance. Unitless with normalisation, in meters
without normalisation. NaN when there are no stem branches.
}
\description{
Calculates the stem branch distance from a TreeQSM.
}
\details{
The stem branch distance is defined as "Average distance between 1st order
branches computed using a moving average with a window width 1 m. If window
is empty average distance in window is set as half of window width. Can be
normalised by the DBH" (Akerblom et al., 2017 & Terryn et al., 2020). When
something different than "dbh" is given, no normalisation is done. Default is
no normalisation. DBH is calculated with \code{\link{dbh}}.
