\title{Alpha-shape Volume point cloud}
\usage{
alpha_volume_pc(pc, alpha = 1, plot = FALSE, plotcolor = "#fac87f")
}
\arguments{
\item{pc}{The point cloud as a data.frame with columns X,Y,Z (e.g. output of
\code{\link{read_tree_pc}}).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric value (default=1) alpha for the computation of the 3D
alpha-shape of the point cloud based on
\code{\link[alphashape3d]{ashape3d}}.}

\item{plot}{Logical (default=FALSE), indicates if the alpha-shape is plotted.}

\item{plotcolor}{color for plotting 3D shape. Only relevant when plot = TRUE.}
}
\value{
The volume of the point cloud (numeric value) as the volume of the 3D
alpha-shape computed from the points of point cloud. Also optionally
(plot=TRUE) plots the alpha-shape and in this case returns a list with the
volume of the point cloud as first element and the alphashape3d object as
the second element. The 3D plot can be reconstructed using
plot(output$alphashape3d).
}
\description{
Returns the alpha shape volume measured from a tree point cloud.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{\link[alphashape3d]{ashape3d}} and
\code{\link[alphashape3d]{volume_ashape3d}} to calculate the volume of 3D the
alpha-shape fitted to the point cloud.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Read tree point cloud and calculate the volume
pc_tree <- read_tree_pc(PC_path = "path/to/point_cloud.txt")
vol_tree <- alpha_volume_pc(pc = pc_tree)
# and plot the 3D alpha-shape
output <- alpha_volume_pc(pc = pc_tree, plot = TRUE)
vol_tree <- output$volume
# classify the tree point cloud and calculate the crown volume
crown_pc <- classify_crown_pc(
  pc, thresholdbranch, minheight, buttress,
  thresholdR2, thresholdbuttress,
  maxbuttressheight, FALSE
)
vol_crown <- volume_crown_pc(pc = crown_pc$crownpoints, alpha = 2)
