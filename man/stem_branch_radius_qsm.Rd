\title{Stem branch radius TreeQSM}
\usage{
stem_branch_radius_qsm(
  cylinder,
  treedata,
  normalisation = "treeheight",
  pc = NA,
  dtm = NA,
  r = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cylinder}{Cylinder field of a TreeQSM that is returned by
\code{\link{read_tree_qsm}}.}

\item{treedata}{Treedata field of a TreeQSM that is returned by
\code{\link{read_tree_qsm}}.}

\item{normalisation}{Can be either "treeheight" or "parentcylinder". In case
of "treeheight" the mean radius of the 10 biggest branches is divided by
the tree height (Terryn et al., 2020). In case of "parentcylinder" the mean
is taken of the ratios of the radius of the 10 biggest branches and the
radius of their parent cylinders (Akerblom et al., 2017). When something
different than "treeheight" or "parentcylinder" is given, no normalisation
is done. Default is no normalisation.}

\item{pc}{The tree point cloud as a data.frame with columns X,Y,Z. Output of
\code{\link{read_tree_pc}}. Default is NA and indicates no tree point cloud
is available. Only relevant if normalisation equals "treeheight".}

\item{dtm}{The digital terrain model as a data.frame with columns X,Y,Z
(default = NA). If the digital terrain model is in the same format as a
point cloud it can also be read with \code{\link{read_tree_pc}}. only
relevant when a point cloud is provided.}

\item{r}{Numeric value (default=5) r which determines the range taken for the
dtm. Should be at least the resolution of the dtm. Only relevant when a dtm
is provided.}
}
\value{
The stem branch radius. Unitless with normalisation, in meters
without normalisation.  NaN when there are no stem branches.
}
\description{
Calculates the stem branch radius from a TreeQSM.
}
\details{
The stem branch radius is defined as "Mean of the 10 largest 1st order
branches measured at the base. Can be normalised by the tree height or the
the stem radius at respective height" (Akerblom et al., 2017 & Terryn et al.,
2020). Tree height is calculated with \code{\link{tree_height}}.
