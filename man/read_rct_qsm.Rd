\title{Read a RCT QSM}
\usage{
read_rct_qsm(path, global = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character with the path to the RCT QSM txt file.}

\item{global}{Logical (default=FALSE), indicates if RCT QSM components should be read into global environment.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the RCT QSM components (cylinder and treedata).
}
\description{
Reads a RayCloudTools (RCT) QSM txt file (.txt) generated using rayextract trees and treeinfo.
This function returns its components in a list and optionally saves the RCT QSM components into
the global environment. It can handle a file including one or multiple RCT QSMs.
}
\details{
The input file contains the following fields:
Tree-level attributes:
\itemize{
\item height: Total height of the tree in meters
\item crown_radius: Approximate radius of the tree crown, calculated as mean of bounding box extents
\item dimension: Fractal dimension of branch lengths (capped at 3.0)
\item monocotal: Metric indicating how strongly the tree resembles a palm tree
\item DBH: Diameter at breast height
\item bend: Trunk bend metric (standard deviation from straight line divided by length)
\item branch_slope: Slope characteristics of the branches
}

Segment-level attributes:
\itemize{
\item volume: Volume of the segment in cubic meters (for root segment: total tree volume)
\item diameter: Segment diameter in meters (for root: maximum diameter in tree)
\item length: Length from segment base to farthest leaf
\item strength: Structural strength metric calculated as diameter^0.75/length
\item min_strength: Minimum strength value between this segment and root
\item dominance: Branch dominance ratio (a1/(a1+a2) for largest child branches)
\item angle: Branch angle at bifurcation points (for root: mean branch angle)
\item children: Number of child segments (for root: mean for tree)
}

Optional branch data attributes (if treeinfo tree.txt --branch_data flag was used):
\itemize{
\item branch: Unique branch identifier
\item branch_order: Branch order number in hierarchy
\item extension: Extension identifier for continuous branch segments
\item pos_in_branch: Position index within the branch
\item segment_length: Length of individual segment
}
